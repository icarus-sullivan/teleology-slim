Dear Bill & Ted,

We were excited to see you, when you came to visit 11:50:46 PM.

It is our hope to bring more people out to visit , it 
would help us greatly if you took two minutes to fill out a quick
survey. 

Survery:
1 How was your stay?
2 How was the response of the staff?
3 Would you suggest our services to your friends?
4 If you could improve one thing, what would it be?

Our warmest thanks,

Fictional Company
